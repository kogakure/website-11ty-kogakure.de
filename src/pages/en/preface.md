This online book only exists because in 1999 two things came together at the same time: my interest in Ninjutsu and my interest in web design.

When I first came into contact with Ninjutsu in the 90’s, information was very difficult to find. There were very few Dōjō in Germany, none of them within reach for me. Books were scarce, and the few books that were available were very difficult to obtain (I had to pay in advance without ever seeing them and wait weeks or even months for delivery). At that time I collected every piece of information that fell into my hands and made notes. This collection of notes became what this website is today.

I use Hepburn spelling for Japanese words, except for a few terms that are so commonplace (e.g. Ninja, Ninjutsu or Samurai). If a term is unclear, you will certainly find an entry in the glossary that describes in more detail what it is about. I don’t pluralize Japanese words, even if it’s allowed. I just think it sounds awful. A Ninja. Two Ninja. Lots of Ninja.
