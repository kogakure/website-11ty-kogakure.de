## The 36 Military Strategies

The Ninja had to have a good grounding in the 18 categories of martial arts (_bugei jūhappan_) and try to become a specialist in them. In addition, a Ninja had to learn another 18 categories of secret techniques (_Ninja jūhakkei_).

The number 36 is special because it can be broken down into 3 and 6. Adding 3 and 6 gives 9. Multiplying 3 and 6 gives 18. Dividing 18 back into 1 and adding 8 gives 9 again. In martial arts, especially the Chinese, the number 9 is special. The number 9 is said to be perfect because 10 begins a new range of numbers (two digits).

The _sanjūrokkei_ often varied, subject areas were dropped, others added. Of course, a Ninja not only learned the _ninpō sanjūrokkei_ but always tried to perfect himself in as many areas as possible.

Of these 36 basic martial arts, 3 are of particular importance. _Taijutsu_ (unarmed combat), _bikenjutsu_ (sword fighting), and _bōjutsu_ (stick fighting). These 3 are also referred to as the _three pillars_ of the ninpō.

Also of great importance is _seishin teki kyōyō_ (spiritual development). Without the spiritual and philosophical aspect, martial art degenerates into an empty shell with no value.
