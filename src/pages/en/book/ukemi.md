_Ukemi_ means _fall_ and encompasses any way of surviving a fall and falling to the ground unscathed. This also includes _kaiten_ (rolls) and other body movements. The Ninja uses the techniques when his legs are knocked over, when he wants to get out of reach of the opponent, or when he wants to evade attacks.

Most martial arts neglect the ability to fall properly and then jump back up, continue fighting, or flee—although it would certainly be necessary. You don’t have a choice where to fight (unless you’re the attacker – and that’s **NOT** the point of Ninjutsu). This can be sitting in a train compartment, in a cramped broom closet, between tables and chairs in a canteen, or on a staircase.

A Ninja must be able to jump off a truck, leap over a high wall, or throw himself with lightning speed – to avoid a bullet.

First, the techniques are performed from a deep, squatting position in slow motion on a mat. Important points are lowering the center of gravity, exhaling, and body relaxation. Later, training takes place on a meadow, then on hard ground, asphalt, stairs, etc.

When you start practicing the forward fall, you should do it on your knees. The forearms form a triangle, palms and forearms catch the fall. The chin is pulled up to avoid hitting the face with the ground. When performing zenpō ukemi from a standing position, one leg is extended upwards.

When falling backward, you hit the ground next to you with your arms and hands at an angle of 45°. One leg is bent and the sole of the foot is on the floor, the other leg is bent sideways inwards. The foot is first placed sideways with the outside flat on the floor. The chin is pressed against the chest so that the back of the head does not hit the ground.

To run up a wall, fence, tree, or person you need to be fast enough, and if the moment of inertia is high enough you can jump at the object, push up with your legs and jump over it.

For practice, you can use a board that you set up at an ever-increasing angle.

- run up vertical surfaces (_shoten_)
