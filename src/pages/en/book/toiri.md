## Chikyujutsu

In this tactic, the Ninja presented a relaxed bow biding his time. When a Ninja was caught, he used this technique. If the hostile master offered him to work for him, he took the opportunity. However, he immediately used the first opportunity to flee.

## Fukurogaeshijutsu

After what appeared to be a fight, the Ninja parted ways with his old master and switched sides. He served his new master for a time. However, when the war reached a critical point, the Ninja carried out his mission and went back to his old master.

## Hotarubijutsu

_The glow of a firefly_ in this tactic meant sending a messenger through enemy territory and having the enemy intercept it with a fake message.

## Joeijutsu

This tactic involves sending a Ninja into enemy territory just before hostilities break out. It was then much easier for the Ninja to go into hiding because the preparations for war were going on everywhere. He could be enlisted as a worker or a soldier.

## Katsuraotokujutsu

This tactic is based on an ancient Chinese tale of a man on the moon. _Katsuraotoku_ was the term for a Ninja in enemy territory. He was isolated from his comrades and dependent on the help of local people. These persons are called _chitsu mishi_. These people offered him their home as a base of operations, helped him with small espionage services, and unobtrusively cared for him.

Sometimes a Ninja would help and provide financial support to a family even in peacetime. So they owed him a favor in times of war.

## Kunoichijutsu

When women were used as agents, they were called _kunoichi_. They were also skilled in combat, like their male comrades, but the bulk of their training also lay in courtly manners, cultivated speech, and psychological influencing. Through them you could get closer to key male figures in order to transport them to the afterlife with poison at the right moment.

## Minomushijutsu

This tactic means _worm in body_. Enemy servants were instigated to betray their master. A high-ranking person was far more important than low-ranking people. Perhaps the Ninja managed to persuade an ally to switch sides with his troops during battle.

## Satobitojutsu

With this tactic, the Ninja looked for a dissatisfied subject of the enemy ruler, a money-greedy or success-seeking person, whom he took into his service. They could serve as informers, keep escape routes clear, or provide them with material and equipment.

## Tanirijutsu

This tactic was the same as _yamabikojutsu_, except that a whole team of Ninja switched sides.

## Tensuijutsu

This tactic (_haunting the sky_) continued to feed information to an enemy Ninja once spotted. However, this was only harmless information or false reports.

Later, you could let the Ninja fall out of favor with his master by obviously wrong information and maybe even recruit him.

## Yamabikojutsu

In this tactic (_the echo of the call_), a Ninja would switch sides and serve his new master for years without ever doubting his loyalty. In response to a predetermined sign, e.g. a light signal or a firework rocket, he changed sides again and before that caused a huge amount of damage or carried out another mission.
