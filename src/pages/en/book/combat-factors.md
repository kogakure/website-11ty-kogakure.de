## Nagare

The principle of flowing action (_nagare_) is one of the most important principles in training. Without a _flow_, the techniques appear choppy and are performed independently. Without the principle, one will try with all one’s strength to adapt a technique to a situation. Because there is no fluid adaptation, only muscle and bone strength is used.

## Renzoku

The combination of several techniques is called _renzoku_. In this way, continuity of techniques arises from the succession or chaining of individual techniques. Only in this way does the individual technique become effective and efficient.

## Ritsudo

Closely related to the flowing action is _ritsudō_. Rhythm is the interplay of two or more individuals. Rhythm is the course of a struggle, the transition from one phase to another. Attack, defense, forward movement, and backward movement. The defender must adapt to the attacker’s movements. The emotional levels of the two opponents, their muscle tension, and muscle relaxation are also part of the rhythm. Rhythm is nothing but the game of cause and effect in combat. An attack follows a defense, which in turn creates an attack – until the fight is over.

## Undō

_Undō_ means movement. This term also includes technique and body movement. The body movement is divided into two areas:

- **Shishi undō** (extremity movement)
- **Tai sabaki** (trunk movement)

## Kokyūhō

Neglected by many, _kokyūhō_ (breathing) is an important component of combat. Most adults breathe through their chests or even through their throats. But this kind of breathing is unnatural.

> The true man breathes with his heels; the mass of men breathe with their throats.

> **Chuang Tzu**

Both children and _real_ people breathe with the diaphragm, i.e. perform abdominal breathing. In this way, the body remains calm and relaxed and the organs are also massaged and gently moved. Most people breathe through their mouths, which is very unhealthy. The nose should be used for both inhalation and exhalation as it filters, humidifies, and warms the air.

When inhaling in abdominal breathing, the abdomen bulges outwards, when exhaling it bulges inwards.

In the past, a simple exercise was used to learn abdominal breathing: you wrapped your stomach tightly with a cloth.

As a result, you are aware of your breathing throughout the day and immediately notice when you switch to chest breathing.

After a few days or weeks, the cloth is no longer necessary because the body has become accustomed to abdominal breathing.

In a fight, breathing will make the difference between victory and loss. It is the key to proper contraction and relaxation (or tension), vigorous movement, and dynamic movement.

## Maai

Of incredible importance in combat is distance. So it is not advisable to be too close to a skilled fighter, but if an opponent needs space to execute his techniques, you will get close to him. One should avoid specializing in techniques that limit one’s range and therefore effectiveness. By moving in unexpected directions, one can give oneself a tremendous advantage. In this way you are freed from the primitive way of fighting, always standing in one spot and just blocking.

## Kikaigaku

The mechanics’ aspect includes the body’s most effective responses to an attack. This includes footwork, side dodges and combat distance, proper use of body weapons, and effective techniques and strategies.

## Doteki

This aspect is the most effective application of mechanics, which involves the proper use of energy, rhythm and flow, strength and flexibility, speed ratios, and the ability to _feel_ and conform to an action.

## Ito

The intention is the clearly recognized goal: victory, the complete subordination of mechanics and dynamics. These include the attitude to use a violent technique, an irrepressible will to win that transcends fear and limits, and an attitude that not only sees victory as the only possible outcome but also sees defeat as a possibility.
