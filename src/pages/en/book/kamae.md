## Expression of Inner Attitude

The fighting positions in _taijutsu_ are more than rules of how to move the body. They are best described if you see them as an expression of the inner attitude. In battle or in life it is always important that body and mind are one. When performed correctly, the _kamae_ reflect the heart of the Ninja.

The point of _kamae_ is not, as in other martial arts, that every fighter adopts the same position, whether or not it suits his body, nor is the point of _kamae_ to imitate any animal, but to move naturally, body, Spirit and soul are said to be one (_shingitai_).

## Flowing, Not Static

The positions are not to be viewed as static forms, like a photograph, but are only occupied as long as they are useful. The fighting positions flow into each other. To e.g. For example, to avoid a deep kick, one could back away from _shizen no kamae_ in _ichimonji no kamae_, immediately raise the attacked foot (_hichō no kamae_), kick the opponent’s knee, and land in _jūmonji no kamae_, immediately in _kosei no kamae_ switch and execute a striking technique against the opponent’s back. What is certainly clear here is that there are five moves in a 2-3 second long combat sequence. Each position is maintained only as long as necessary. Under no circumstances does one stay longer in one position, as is common in other martial arts.

## Natural Movement

As the student develops, the _kamae_ become less and less important as specific positions and are incorporated into the fighter’s natural movement. Once these basics are mastered, the most important combat stance becomes the _non-combat stance_.

There are a large number of combat positions, e.g. also differ among the Ryū or bear other names, in addition, each fighting position can be taken at different heights (e.g. also kneeling) or be aimed at different heights.

Some of these positions are explained and shown below:

## Observational Positions

The observation fighting positions are the basic positions. These stances are standing or sitting stances that one would normally be in when being attacked. From these positions you also bow and show respect to your opponent. Because these poses were developed in the Eastern world, where there are no chairs like in the Western world, the observing poses are natural sitting and standing positions.

### Gasshō no kamae

The _fudoza no kamae_ posture is the traditional Japanese sitting posture. The left leg is folded under the body and the seat rests on the ankle of the left foot. The right leg is pulled in front of the body with the sole of the right foot against the knee. The back is straight and the spine is in its natural position. The view goes straight ahead.

The _seiza no kamae_ pose is the traditional Japanese kneeling pose. The legs are crossed behind the body and the seat rests on the soles of the feet. The upper body is straight, the knees slightly apart. The hands rest on the thighs. To show respect, bend your torso forward and place your palms on the floor in front of you.

## Defending Positions

The defending battle stances are used when you need to respond to an attack by blocking or dodging before you can launch a counterattack. The body slips or slides in or out, away from the attack. You can then block or attack from this position.

### Ichi no kamae

{% figure "Ichi no kamae" %}

![Ichi no kamae](/assets/images/book/kamae-ichi.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

_Ichi no Kamae_ is performed by stepping one leg forward in _shizen_ and allowing most of the body weight to rest on the back leg. The body is turned obliquely away from the enemy. The front hand points towards the enemy, the back hand remains as a fist on the belt. This position is the position taken before _ichimonji no kamae_.

### Ichimonji no kamae

{% figure "Ichimonji no kamae" %}

![Ichimonji no kamae](/assets/images/book/kamae-ichimonji.jpg)

The _ichimonji no kamae_ stance is performed with the body pulling back and dodging away from the attack. The back leg keeps the body upright.

### Hicho no kamae

{% figure "Hichō no kamae" %}

![Hichō no kamae](/assets/images/book/kamae-hicho.jpg)

The _hichō no kamae_ stance is used to evade an attack and the front leg is waiting to attack the opponent. To keep the balance, the leg standing on the floor is slightly bent. The arms are in a position to grab, block, or deliver punches.

## Receiving Positions

The receiving fighting stances are used when responding to attacks with techniques that harmonize with the opponent’s power or go along with it. The body rotates or moves sideways to blend in with the enemy’s movement. Defenses are applied in the same way.

### Shizen no kamae

{% figure "Shizen no kamae" %}

![Shizen no kamae](/assets/images/book/kamae-shizen.jpg)

The _Shizen no kamae_ posture is man’s natural standing position. The mind is alert, the body is relaxed and ready to move and react to the opponent. Body weight is on both feet, shoulders are relaxed, and arms hang naturally at your sides. This stance will be found in most attacks as it is the natural movement of walking or standing. Therefore, it is also the most important position and should be trained well.

### Hanmi no kamae
