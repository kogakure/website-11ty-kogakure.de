## The School of the Jeweled Heart

Gyokushin-Ryū Ninjutsu is a branch of _koshi jutsu_ and is believed to have been founded by Sasaki Goeman Teruyoshi, a student of Gyokko-Ryū. The methods of Kumogakure-Ryū (blocks, punches, and stances) are very similar to those of Gyokko-Ryū.

Sasaki Gendayu was in the service of the Daimyō of Kishu and received a salary of 200 _kokū_ (Japanese capacity for rice, one _kokū_ equals about 180 liters of rice) per year, later even 400 _kokū_. Like his father, he was probably very capable of Gyokko-Ryū.

The Gyokushin-Ryū was taught in secret, in the Kishu and Takeda provinces. Sometime in the 17th century, he came into contact with the Togakure-Ryū and the Toda family. After the style was passed down to Toda Nobutsuna, it was no longer kept secret.

Little is known about the combat system of the Gyokushin-Ryū. The system was more focused on espionage and other Ninja skills than combat.

The Gyokushin-Ryū is known for its use of the _nagenawa_ (lasso).

Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo, was a friend of Takamatsu Sensei. It is believed that Takamatsu taught Gyokushin-Ryū as a guest at the Kodokan.
