The weaponless _taijutsu_ is expanded by the possibility of being able to draw from a pool of numerous weapons. The Ninja have proven to be quick to adapt to modern times, improving or modifying weapons to make them more useful. For a Ninja, a weapon was no more than a tool to achieve his goal. In complete contrast to the Samurai, who paid special attention to their swords. For them, it was an outrage that Ninja sometimes simply sawed the blade shorter to be able to move better with the sword.

The Ninja recognized the use of firearms early on, long before the first Daimyō mastered the use of firearms.

Below is a _small_ – by no means exhaustive – selection of weapons favored by Ninja.

## Aikuchi

A small dagger very similar to the _tantō_ that was worn in the obi.

## Ashikō

{% figure "Ashiko" %}

![Ashikō](/assets/images/book/waffen-ashiko.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The counterpart to the _shukō_ is the _ashi kō_. A device similar to that on the hand was placed under the Ninja’s foot. Getting kicked made worse injuries that way, and climbing was far easier.

## Baku hatsu gama

{% figure "Baku hatsu gama" %}

![Baku hatsu gama](/assets/images/book/waffen-bakuhatsugama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

At the end of the _bakuhatsugama_, the Ninja attached explosives, poisons, or blinding powder. He threw it in the attacker’s face and then attacked him with the sickle.

## Bisentō

{% figure "Bisentō" %}

![Bisentō](/assets/images/book/waffen-bisento.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The heavy halberd was introduced from China and required a different style of fighting than the _naginata_. It was far more massive, and in the hands of a strong warrior a formidable weapon.

## Bō

{% figure "Bō" %}

![Bō](/assets/images/book/waffen-bo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

One of the simplest weapons was probably the staff or stick. What is known today as the _bō_ is actually the _roku shaku bō_ with a length of approximately 182 cm. At first glance, the weapon doesn’t look very dangerous, but in the hands of a master, this all-purpose weapon is deadly. It could be used to stab or slash, and was also very effective against multiple opponents, making it a popular weapon among Ninja.

## Bō shuriken

Knife- or arrow-shaped, elongated _shuriken_.

## Bō ken

{% figure "Bō ken" %}

![Bō ken](/assets/images/book/waffen-boken.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _bokken_ or _bokutō_. Wooden sword made of heavy wood for practice. Usually even heavier than a sharp sword, it was a relief for the student when he got his _daishō_.

## Bokken

Also _bōken_ or _bokutō_.

## Bokutō

Also _bōken_ or _bokken_.

## Chi giri ki

A long stick and a chain with an iron weight on the end. Originally developed by farmers from the flail to defend themselves against attackers.

## Daisharin

{% figure "Daisharin" %}

![Daisharin](/assets/images/book/waffen-daisharin.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _daisharin_ consisted of two wheels with an axle. The Ninja liked to use it to knock down larger groups of attackers or to use it as an improved staff.

## Daishō

_Big-small_, the designation for the pair of swords of the Samurai (_katana_ and _wakizashi_). Actually, only the Samurai were allowed to carry two swords, but a Ninja didn’t care, because as a non-noble he wasn’t allowed to carry weapons anyway.

## Daitō

_Big Sword_, a sword with a particularly long blade (between 60 and 180 cm).

## Eiku

Boat rudder, actually an Okinawan weapon. When the Ninja was in disguise as a fisherman, it was a good way to defend himself.

## Endoku ken

{% figure "Endoku ken" %}

![Endoku ken](/assets/images/book/waffen-endokuken.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The Ninja also used throwing stars that released poisonous smoke when lit. In this way, one could force hidden enemies to reveal themselves.

## Fukiya

{% figure "Fukiya" %}

![Fukiya](/assets/images/book/waffen-fukiya.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The blowgun was popular because it could kill the enemy quietly. The bolts were poisoned, stifling every scream. Disguised as a flute, a blowgun could be carried around freely.

## Fukumi bari

Small darts that the Ninja spat in an attacker’s face.

## Futokoro teppō

{% figure "Futokoro teppō" %}

![Futokoro teppō](/assets/images/book/waffen-futokoroteppo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The bronze pistol was popular with the Ninja because it was small and easy to conceal. Sometimes a bayonet was put on the gun.

## Hanbō

{% figure "Hanbō" %}

![Hanbō](/assets/images/book/waffen-hanbo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _half staff_ or stick, although very short at 3 feet, was a very effective weapon. The correct term is actually _sanshakubō_.

## Hankyū

{% figure "Hankyū" %}

![Hankyū](/assets/images/book/waffen-hankyu.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _half staff_ or stick, although very short at 3 feet, was a very effective weapon. The correct term is actually _sanshakubōa_. The bow of the Ninja was far shorter than the bow of the Samurai. This made it easier to transport and hide. The shorter range usually didn’t matter much, as Ninja rarely needed to hit distant targets on the battlefield, most of the time only close targets. Explosives or incendiary materials were often attached to the arrows, especially since almost all buildings in Japan were made of wood. You could also use special arrows to cut ropes or create a howling sound that terrified enemies.

## Hira shuriken

Star-shaped flat throwable objects.

## Hishi

{% figure "Hishi" %}

![Hishi](/assets/images/book/waffen-hishi.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Dried water chestnuts served the same purpose as the _tetsubishi_ but were easier to obtain. In addition, they did not arouse suspicion, because in rural areas this plant was quite common.

## Iga dama

{% figure "Iga dama" %}

![Iga dama](/assets/images/book/waffen-igadama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

This weapon could be used in a similar way to the _tetsubishi_, in addition to being thrown at enemies. They liked to be hidden all over the Ninja house to defend themselves against attackers.

## Jirai

Also _Uzume bi_.

## Jō

{% figure "Jō" %}

![Jō](/assets/images/book/waffen-jo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The walking stick was a shortened form of _roku shaku bō_. It reached the waist or abdomen and could be used in a similar way to the staff. Its proper term is _yon shaku bō_.

## Jutte

Hand weapon with a hook that could be used to intercept a sword attack.

## Kagi yari

{% figure "Kagi yari" %}

![Kagi yari](/assets/images/book/waffen-kagiyari.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _kama yari_. Togakure-Ryū and kumogakure-Ryū Ninja often used the hook spear. You could get into trees, over walls, or onto ships. It was also possible to get from tree to tree in this way. Hidden on a high post, a victim could be caught with the hook and pulled up. It was also suitable for fishing, breaking down doors, or transporting luggage.

## Kama

{% figure "Kama" %}

![Kama](/assets/images/book/waffen-kama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Short-handled sickle used in Asia to cut rice, corn, or sugar cane.

## Kama yari

Also _kagi yari_.

## Kanzashi

Fork-shaped hairpin. Often used as a weapon by the _kunoichi_.

## Katana

Samurai longsword, with a curved blade, manufactured in a complex forging process with different degrees of steel hardness, the best sword weapon in the world, with a blade length of 61 to 76 cm.

## Kogai

Sword pin or hairpin. The sword needle was actually a tool placed on the side of the _saya_. But it could also be used as a throwing or thrusting weapon.

## Kongō

{% figure "Kongō" %}

![Kongō](/assets/images/book/waffen-kongosho.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Sanskrit _Vajra_. The scepter symbolizes the diamond, used by esoteric sects. Also served as a baton.

## Kubotan

Also _yawara_. Percussion weapon, in the shape of a cylinder. Suitable for grab handles or to apply pressure to joints. Similarities in usage in _kongō_.

## Kusari fundō

{% figure "Kusari fundō" %}

![Kusari fundō](/assets/images/book/waffen-kusarifundo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _manrikigusari_. The chain was a useful weapon. It could be easily concealed and was even suitable for intercepting sword blows, binding opponents, choking them, or knocking them off their feet.

## Kusarigama

{% figure "Kusarigama" %}

![Kusarigama](/assets/images/book/waffen-kusarigama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _kusarigama_ was a popular weapon. Attached to a rice sickle was a chain one to two meters long. A weight was attached to the end of the chain. When attacked, a Ninja would throw the weight around the attacker’s blade, forcing the attacker to lower his weapon. After that, he attacked the enemy with the sickle.

## Ku shaku bō

Extra-long stick (270 cm).

## Kyoketsu shoge

{% figure "Kyoketsu shoge" %}

![Kyoketsu shoge](/assets/images/book/waffen-kyoketsushoge.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Probably the Ninja’s most popular weapon was the _kyoketsu shoge_. A knife with a hook, an 18-foot (est. 5,49 m) long rope attached to the handle, and a steel ring at the end. The rope was often made of women’s hair since hair was particularly strong. With this weapon, the Ninja could control the opponent’s weapon, attack with the knife, block a sword stroke with the hook, or knock the enemy off their feet. He could climb and tie with the rope and firecrackers could also be attached to the steel ring to blind the enemy.

## Kyū

Also _yumi_.

## Mamukugama

{% figure "Mamukugama" %}

![Mamukugama](/assets/images/book/waffen-mamukugama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

With this weapon, a poisonous animal was attached to the end of the rope, such as a snake. This was thrown at the enemy and this made the fight much easier because the animal kept the enemy busy and maybe even killed them.

## Manriki gusari

Also _kusari fundō_. <q>A chain with the power of 10,000</q>. Chain with lengths from 40 to 400 cm and weights at the ends. Was developed in the 17th century by Masaki Toshimitsu, a gatekeeper in Edo, as a defensive weapon against swords.

## Metsubushi

When a Ninja was spotted, they were usually outnumbered. To escape safely, however, he used blinding powder to limit the enemy’s vision. In eggshells or nutshells, he kept a powder consisting of chemicals, ash, sand, iron filings, pepper, or nettle hairs. It could blind the enemy for a short time, or it could destroy eyesight forever.

## Nageteppō

{% figure "Nageteppō" %}

![Nageteppō](/assets/images/book/waffen-nageteppo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

These explosive grenades were thrown at the enemy by hand or with slingshots and worked on the same principle as a hand grenade does today.

## Naginata

{% figure "Naginata" %}

![Naginata](/assets/images/book/waffen-naginata.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The sword spear was a _sōhei_ weapon and the weapon of choice for Samurai women. They came in different forms (e.g. _nagamaki_), varying in blade-to-handle ratio, length, and blade thickness. It was a very effective weapon against mounted warriors, long as a spear and capable of severing limbs. After World War II it was used predominantly by women in the _naginatadō_.

## Nagishi-shuriken

Also _bō-shuriken_. Arrow-shaped projectiles that had a tassel at the end for flight stabilization.

## Neko te

{% figure "Neko te" %}

![Neko te](/assets/images/book/waffen-nekote.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _kunoichi_ sometimes wore such a _cat’s claw_ on each finger. It could inflict terrible wounds on an attacker’s face.

## Ninja tō

{% figure "Ninja tō" %}

![Ninja tō](/assets/images/book/waffen-ninjato.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _Ninjaken_ or _Shinobi katana_. The short sword was an important tool in Ninja equipment. It wasn’t pretty or valuable like the _tachi_ or _katana_ of the Samurai – it was useful. The blade was much shorter than that of the _katana_ or the _tachi_. So the Ninja could move better with it and use it in close combat. The blade was sometimes straight, but sometimes it was just a shortened _katana_. The _tsuba_ was not decorated with beautiful ornaments but mostly larger and made of simple steel, often angular. So you could use it as a climbing aid. The sword was carried at the side and only rarely (e.g. when climbing) over the back or stomach. Poisons, medicines, or chemicals were often hidden in the handle. The _saya_ could be used as a blowpipe or a breathing tube.

## Ninja ken

Also _Ninja tō_ or _Shinobi katana_.

## Nodachi

Very long Samurai swords with blade lengths of 100 to 180 cm, carried either on the back or by a servant.

## Nuntebō

A fishing spear is a tool used by fishermen, but it could also be used as a weapon.

## Ōgama

{% figure "Ōgama" %}

![Ōgama](/assets/images/book/waffen-ogama.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _ōgama_ was the battlefield version of the _kusarigama_. The chain was strong enough to knock horses off their feet. The sickle could pierce or cut through armor with ease.

## Ono

{% figure "Ono" %}

![Ono](/assets/images/book/waffen-ono.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The heavy war ax was brought from China after the fall of the T’ang Dynasty. It could smash through castle gates, knock warriors from their horses, or nullify any attack with a weaker weapon.

## Ōzutsu

{% figure "Ōzutsu" %}

![Ōzutsu](/assets/images/book/waffen-ozutsu.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Togakure-Ryū Ninja used wooden cannons from very early on to be victorious in larger battles. This weapon was very effective against larger cavalry units or castle gates.

## Ono gama

A weapon consisting of a heavy war ax and a _kama_. Used by the _sōhei_ and the Ninja.

## Roku shaku bō

A _shaku_ was 30.3 cm. _Roku_ means six. The exact term for the _bō_.

## San shaku bō

A _shaku_ was 30.3 cm. _San_ means three. The exact term for the _Hanbō_.

## Sembanshaken

Term for a _shuriken_ with a hole in the middle.

## Shaken

_Shuriken_ with multiple prongs.

## Shakuhachi

Flute, 30.3 cm (1 _shaku_) long with eight (_hachi_) lateral holes. The flute was used by the _komusō_. Ninja liked to disguise their blowgun as a _shakuhachi_.

## Shakujō

{% figure "Shakujō" %}

![Shakujō](/assets/images/book/waffen-shakujo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The staff of the priests was often used when a Ninja disguised himself as a monk. The staff has rings at the end, the sound of which the monk used to drive crawling animals off the path so that he could observe the law of non-killing and not accidentally step on an animal.

## Shikomizue

{% figure "Shikomizue" %}

![Shikomizue](/assets/images/book/waffen-shikomizue.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

When a Ninja was on the move, he couldn’t always carry a sword openly with him. The _shikomizue_ was a sword hidden in a stick. Outwardly it looked like an ordinary staff, but that could be changed quickly.

## Shinobi shobō

{% figure "Shinobi shobō" %}

![Shinobi shobō](/assets/images/book/waffen-shinobishobo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The _shinobi shobō_ is a predecessor of today’s brass knuckles and works in the same way. The middle finger is put through a steel ring and the rest of the weapon is hidden in the fist.

## Shinobi katana

Also _Ninja tō_ or _Ninja ken_.

## Shinobi kai

Also _shinobi zue_.

## Shinobi tantō

{% figure "Shinobi tantō" %}

![Shinobi tantō](/assets/images/book/waffen-shinobitanto.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The Ninja also used _tantō_, like the Samurai. But then they were mostly camouflaged or hidden in clothing. The _shinobi tantō_ was disguised as a short stick, similar to the _shikomi zue_.

## Shinobi zue

{% figure "Shinobi zue" %}

![Shinobi zue](/assets/images/book/waffen-shinobizue.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _shinobi kai_. The Ninja liked to use staffs and sticks because carrying them was considered commonplace in Japan’s Middle Ages. Everyone carried a staff with them while hiking. Only the staves of the Ninja were modified. Usually, they were hollow, and inside were hidden knives, poisons, blinding powder, or chains with weights. When a Ninja was attacked, he quickly opened the staff’s cover and an iron ball attached to a chain flew out and the Ninja was able to use it to knock the enemy off his feet. Or he hurled poison, blinding powder, or other weapons at him. This is how a normal walking staff quickly turned into a spear, poison splatter, or morning star.

## Shukō

{% figure "Shukō" %}

![Shukō](/assets/images/book/waffen-shuko.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _tekagi_. A terrible weapon is the _shukō_. A pointed iron prong was attached to a kind of leather arm ring, whereby the Ninja turned his hand into a tiger claw. The spikes could inflict terrible wounds on the attacker’s face. With this weapon, the Ninja could also _take swords_, i.e. stop the sword strike. At the same time, the Ninja could climb up walls or trees better. The counterpart for the feet was called _ashi kō_.

## Shuriken

{% figure "Shuriken" %}

![Shuriken](/assets/images/book/waffen-shuriken.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The most famous weapons were the throwing blades. As _hira shuriken_ in star form or as _bō-shuriken_ in dagger form. Each weapon required its own throwing technique. The throwing blades could be poisoned and also used in close combat. The _senban shaken_ was the typical throwing star of Togakure-Ryū. It had four points and looked like a diamond. There was a hole in the middle. The sides were ground sharp. The throwing star was very thin and light, so nine could always be carried together in the inside pocket.

## Sodezutsu

{% figure "Sodezutsu" %}

![Sodezutsu](/assets/images/book/waffen-sodezutsu.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The smaller brother of the _ōzutsu_ was the _sodezutsu_. This cannon could be fired from the hand and was a forerunner of rifles.

## Tachi

Old longsword with a blade 61 to 76 cm long. The _tachi_ was usually more curved at the handle than the _katana_ and was fastened horizontally with the blade down on the belt in front of the body. The _katana_ was tucked into the belt with the blade up. Initially used as a battle sword, later mostly only for ceremonial occasions.

## Tanegashima

{% figure "Tanegashima" %}

![Tanegashima](/assets/images/book/waffen-tanegashima.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Also _teppo_. The Ninja were probably the first to see the utility of the arquebuses that the Portuguese introduced to Japan. Long before the weapon was used in battle, it was used in assassination attempts by the Ninja.

## Tantō

Dagger. The blade was less than 30 cm long. The _tantō_ was used as a defensive weapon by many people from all walks of life.

## Tekagi

Also _shukō_.

## Tekkō

Brass knuckles, exactly like modern brass knuckles in appearance and function.

## Teppō

Also _tanegashima_.

## Tessen

{% figure "Tessen" %}

![Tessen](/assets/images/book/waffen-tessen.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The War Fan was a popular weapon because it didn’t look like a weapon at first glance. With the fan, the outer parts were made of steel, sometimes it wasn’t even a fan at all but just a piece of steel in the shape of a fan. With this weapon, you could inflict pain on the joints or control it with it.

## Tetsubishi

{% figure "Tetsubishi" %}

![Tetsubishi](/assets/images/book/waffen-tetsubishi.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

When a Ninja was being pursued, he would scatter a handful of these iron metal spikes on the ground. Since straw sandals were worn in Japan, it was extremely painful to step on the thorns and a pursuit could not continue. What was brilliant about this weapon was that no matter how you threw it, there was always a spike sticking up. Also occurs naturally in nature (_hishi_).

## Tetsubō

{% figure "Tetsubō" %}

![Tetsubō](/assets/images/book/waffen-tetsubo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

This weapon was probably used all over the world and is one of the most primitive. Steel spikes were attached to a mace to increase effectiveness.

## Toami

{% figure "Toami" %}

![Toami](/assets/images/book/waffen-toami.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The web was used by the Ninja to defend themselves against a variety of attackers. In the fishing villages, it was an everyday tool and was hardly noticed. It could also be set up in forests or corridors as a trap.

## Tonki

Also _shuriken_.

## Torinawa

A pointed shaft attached to a chain or string and had a weight at the end.

## Tori no ko

firecrackers. Imported early from China. Only used to distract and confuse. Later, after the introduction of black powder, explosives were also manufactured.

## Uzume bi

Also _jirai_. These land mines were buried deep underground. An enemy who stepped on the box set the firing mechanism in motion and was killed or seriously wounded by an explosion.

## Wakizashi

_Companion of the Belt_, a short sword resembling its larger image the _katana_. Together with the _katana_ formed the _daishō_.

## Wakizashi teppō

{% figure "Wakizashi teppō" %}

![Wakizashi teppō](/assets/images/book/waffen-wakizashiteppo.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

Concealed inside a traditional short sword was a pistol that could fire one shot.

## Yon shaku bō

A _shaku_ was 30.3cm. _Yon_ means four. The exact term for the _jō_.

## Yari

{% figure "Yari" %}

![Yari](/assets/images/book/waffen-yari.jpg)

{% endfigure %}

The Japanese spears were designed to stab and were rarely thrown. With its small point, one could easily fit between the plates of the Samurai armor. The tips were mostly two- or three-sided. It was usually 200 to 350 cm long. Oda Nobunaga used _yari_, some 640 cm long, to protect his _teppō_ soldiers against cavalry.

The Ninja often used the _yari_ to high jump over walls or people.

## Yawara

Also _kubotan_.

## Yumi

Also _kyū_. Arrow (_ya_) and bow (_yumi_). The Japanese bow was made from different layers of wood or bamboo and is approximately 220 cm long. It is one of the few bows in the world with an asymmetrical shape. The arrow rests in the lower third.
