Some leather sacks that could be filled with air. The Ninja sat on the middle cushion and was able to translate across water surfaces with his legs in the water. Using the _shinobi kai_ (fold-out paddle), he moved forward.

This tool was most likely used to walk across swampland. The wooden shields were tied to the feet. So the Ninja didn’t sink. For snow, the Ninja probably used an instrument that must have been very similar to today’s snowshoes.

## Mizukaki

Flippers.

## Mizu tsutsu

Hidden in a hollow bamboo stick were some iron parts that could be quickly converted into a paddle.

Also _uki daru_.

Each member of a larger Ninja team could transport part of the boat. When they reached the water, they quickly built a boat out of it.

## Uki daru

With one leg in each of these floating baskets and a pole in hand to secure and propel themselves, the Ninja could cover greater distances across the water.
