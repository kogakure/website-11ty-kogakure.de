The Ninja used some sort of telescope on their missions. So they were able to observe the enemy army without great danger. Sometimes the binoculars were disguised as _tant≈ç_.

## Hito washi

Also _yamidoko_. The Ninja also had a flying machine that allowed them to glide through the air. This allowed them to jump off a fortress wall and fly away after completing a quest.

## Inr≈ç

The Ninja‚Äôs first-aid kit contained the necessary medicines and poisons that he needed on his missions. Medication for pain, cuts, poisoning or other ailments. The Ninja also kept his poisons in the first-aid kit.

## Kagami

This steel mirror was used to send signals to teammates or allies, or blind the enemy.

The compass was probably developed by pirates but was also used by the Ninja who were in close contact with the _wako_ (Japanese pirates). A piece of wood with a magnetized piece of iron was floating in a bowl of water. So the Ninja could orientate himself very precisely. But the compass without a water bowl was probably also used.

## Kito gan

The Ninja knew a pill that could quell the thirst for a few days. This allowed the Ninja to run long distances without having to look for water sources.

## Onibi

Wearing grisly wooden masks, the Ninja could terrify his pursuers and deter them from pursuing, or at least demobilize them morally. üëπ

## Yamidoko

Also _hito washi_.
