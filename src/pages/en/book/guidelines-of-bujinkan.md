> - The Bujinkan Budō is open to anyone who agrees with and supports the guidelines. Those who do not consent will be denied entry.
> - Only those who practice true patience, self-control, and dedication shall be allowed entry. People with mental illness, drug addiction, or mental instability are not allowed to participate. The need for a medical examination concerns people who could pose a danger to others, e.g. those with infectious diseases, persons with clinically abnormal personality or physiology, and persons lacking self-control.
> - Persons with criminal records will be turned away. Troublemakers and those who have committed crimes are turned away.
> - Those who do not comply with the guidelines of the Bujinkan, whether as practitioners or members of society, by committing shameful or criminal acts will be expelled. Until now, the Bujinkan has been open to a large number of people coming to Japan. Unfortunately, among them were those who committed violent acts while drunk, the insane, and troublemakers who thought only of themselves and failed to see their actions being rejected by others. By their actions, these persons defiled the righteous heart of the Bujinkan. From that day on, all persons of this kind will be expelled.
> - In the case of accidents that take place during the training (in the dojo and outside), the Bujinkan must not cause any problems. This is a very important point. Those who do not take personal responsibility for accidents in Bujinkan training will not be admitted. Repeatedly for the sake of clarity, the Bujinkan takes no responsibility for any kind of accident during the training, regardless of the location.
> - All those who wish to join the Bujinkan must purchase an annual membership card. This card not only protects the honor of Bujinkan members but also shows that you are a part of a greater whole whose warrior-hearted members come together to improve themselves through training and friendship.
> - The Bujinkan tradition recognizes the nature and commonality in all human life and is aware of what flows naturally between the two parts:
>   - The secret principle of _taijutsu_ is knowing the basis of peace.
>   - Learning is the path of the unwavering heart (_fudōshin_).
>
> Recently, the Bujinkan has become truly international. Just as there are different time zones, there are also different prohibitions between different peoples and nations. We must respect each other and strive to avoid such prohibitions. The warrior’s heart must be foremost, collaborating for self-improvement and improvement of the Bujinkan.
>
> Those who do not comply with the above guidelines will be expelled from the Bujinkan.
