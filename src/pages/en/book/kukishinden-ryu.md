## The School of the Nine Demon Gods

This school is the one with the most connections and relatives to all Bujinkan Ryūha. There are other _sōke_ of Kukishin-Ryū, e.g. the Hontai-yoshin-Ryū. As far as the story goes, the Kukishinden-Ryū is a branch school of the Kukishin-Ryū that Takamatsu was allowed to found in gratitude for his reconstruction of the _densho_. He was originally declared the _sōke_ of the Kukishin-Ryū, but had to relinquish that title to Iwami Nangaku because he went missing while traveling in China.

Aikido is also said to have descended from the Kukishin-Ryū, Ueshiba Morihei is said to have learned his staff techniques from the _sōke_ of the Kukishin-Ryū.

The founder of Jūdō, Kano Jigoro, also learned techniques from Takamatsu Sensei.
