## Fitness and Mobility

_Jūnantaisō_ is the Ninja conditioning training to improve suppleness, speed and reactions in order to be able to use the techniques of _taijutsu_ effectively. In Ninjutsu, strength is gained through flexibility. Muscles and tendons regain their natural elasticity. _Jūnantaisō_ – in connection with a proper diet – keeps the body healthy into old age.

The muscular system can be divided into two areas. Weak muscles are strengthened with fast repetition exercises. With this type of training, which is characterized by rapid alternations of contraction and relaxation, a feeling of physical exhaustion may occur.

The second system allows rigid and immobile muscles to be improved through stretching. This type of training is also known from Indian yoga. In this type of training, the positions are held for a few seconds while the muscles are relaxed.

It should always be borne in mind that _jūnantaisō_ is not a simple _warm-up_ before combat practice, but provides a vital, healthy foundation. The body learns to function in harmony with all parts again.

Below are some examples from the _jūnantaisō_, but there are countless other exercises to improve flexibility, strength, and endurance. Pull-ups, sit-ups, various push-ups, and stretching exercises for all parts of the body.
