## Locks, Punches, Kicks

The martial art of _taijutsu_ is a fighting method that does not only consist of punches, throws, or holds. The whole body is used as a defensive weapon. The Japanese word _ken_ is a term for all-natural weapons. Just as combat stances are constantly adapting to circumstances, natural weapons are constantly adapting to the situation. Gripping hands become fists, and maybe claw hands again. And kicking feet might turn into knee kicks. The hip and shoulder are used for leverage and ramming.

Another distinctive feature of Ninjutsu is that it uses the dynamics of natural weapons. It doesn’t just use pure muscle power to deliver a powerful punch, but a combination of body energy, body balance, and breath control to produce a terrifying, knock-down effect. This natural power, combined with speed and scientific knowledge of the human body’s weak points, becomes a deadly and effective weapon.

The bony structure of the head – especially the forehead – is used to slam, jab, ram, or stretch the enemy’s joints. When grabbed from behind, you can inflict excruciating pain on the back of your enemy’s head by slamming your head back into their face. The head can also be rammed against the breastbone or chin.

## Shuki ken – Elbow
