## Pressure and Blow to Nerve Points

_Atemite_ is the name of the pressure, blow or impact on the approximately 250 sensitive areas of the human body. The effects of the blows range from harmless pain that forces the opponent to submit, others (69 critical) are classified as dangerous because they can lead to unconsciousness, paralysis, or death. These points are nerve centers, vital organs, or concentrations of blood vessels.

When training, the points must **never** be hit with full force, but only lightly touched or pressed with increasing pressure to check whether the point has been hit!

A Ninja should always know exactly about the points of the body, on the one hand, to be able to protect himself better and on the other hand to be able to defend himself effectively.

To achieve an effect with _atemi_, the blows must be mastered perfectly and placed extremely precisely (on the smallest possible area). In order not to kill the opponent immediately, you have to calculate the opponentâ€™s constitution and thus determine the hit dosage.

To better protect yourself, it is essential to develop a strong chest and abdominal muscles.
